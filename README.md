## Diffusion models

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/InFoCusp/diffusion_models/blob/main/Diffusion_models.ipynb)

A minimal standalone example of diffusion model. The objective is to understand the forward as well as reverse mapping process of diffusion models.
The notebook contains the equations along side the code and some visualizations.

Hope you find it useful!
